# Pokemon Workshop


### Instructions
The goal of the workshop is to make you work with a complex API, the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/). It is the largest pokemon database that you can find, gathering all the information that you need to create the ultimate pokedex.
You are free to use everything we have learned so far. Also feel free to use the CSS library you want to make the workshop.

### Steps & User stories example :
There are no features required besides that I want you to fetch a list of pokemon and display each pokemon inside a card with his name and an image of the pokemon. 
You are free to implement any features, here are user story examples you can take inspiration from :

- As a user I want to see a list of the first generation of pokemons
- As a user I want to search for a pokemon based on his name
- As a user I want to search for a pokemon based on his type
- As a user I want to save my favourite pokemon

API call for the first 150 pokemon : [API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=150)

Once again it is a complex API and you will have sometimes to do multiple API calls to succeed.
